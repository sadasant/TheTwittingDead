# The Twitting Dead

This code was for a little game I made back in 2010.
I was using [RaphaÃ«lJS](http://raphaeljs.com/) version 1.5.2
and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) version 1.5.2.
I also used Twitter's Public API and some HTML5
from that time.

The game consist on a FPS 2D Zombie thriller - kind of,
in which you start on a street, after the apocalypse,
with a bunch of gun bullets (your tweets) and
shotgun bullets (your favorites), and a
crow bar. The goal is to survive.
If you "play online", the Zombies will
be actually your Twitter followers.
